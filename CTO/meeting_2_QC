Considering the new breakdown provided by the Quantum Compressors, I suggest the following adjusted timelines and benchmarks for Team 3:

Timeline:

Initial Setup and Communication: 1 week
Collaboration with Other Teams: Ongoing throughout the project
Test Plan Development: 1 week
Test Execution and Optimization: 4 weeks
Keylog Compression Library Development: 3 weeks
User Interface Design: 2 weeks
Integration and Testing with QMK Keyboards: 2 weeks
Continuous Improvement and Optimization: Ongoing throughout the project
Progress Monitoring and Reporting: Ongoing throughout the project
Knowledge Transfer and Support: Ongoing throughout the project
Benchmarks:

Week 1: Complete initial setup, communication, and collaboration tools
Week 2: Complete test plan development, including test objectives, schedule, and test cases
Week 6: Complete test execution and optimization, identifying optimal compression technique combinations
Week 9: Complete keylog compression library development and ensure compatibility with QMK framework
Week 11: Complete user interface design and implementation
Week 13: Complete integration and testing with QMK keyboards, addressing any bugs or issues
These adjusted timelines and benchmarks will help Team 3 stay on track and effectively collaborate with other teams throughout the project. Regular communication and progress updates will be crucial for ensuring alignment with project objectives and overall success.
