Team 1: Research and Compression Techniques Development
Team Name: KeyCompress Innovators
  Objectives:
    Conduct research on compression techniques and key event log characteristics.
    Implement standalone compression and decompression functions.
    
  Tasks:
    Review existing literature and resources on compression techniques.
    Collect and analyze key event logs to understand their characteristics and patterns.
    Develop standalone compression and decompression functions for RLE, Variable-length encoding, Dictionary-based compression, and Differential encoding.
    Implement the techniques in a modular manner to ensure easy integration with other methods.


Team 2: Test Environment and Performance Evaluation
Team Name: KeyCompress Crusadors
  Objectives:
    Develop a test environment with diverse key event logs.
    Implement performance evaluation metrics for the compression techniques.
  
  Tasks:
    Obtain or create a diverse set of key event logs for testing purposes.
    Design and develop a test environment to assess the performance of compression techniques.
    Implement performance evaluation metrics, such as compression ratio, processing time, and memory usage.


Team 3: Experimentation, Optimization, and QMK Integration
Team Name: Quantum Compressors
  Objectives:
    Optimize compression techniques by testing them individually and in combination.
    Integrate the compression techniques into the QMK framework.
    
  Tasks:
    Conduct tests on individual compression techniques and their combinations.
    Analyze the results to identify the most effective combinations of compression techniques.
    Develop the keylog compression library that integrates the chosen techniques into the QMK framework.
    Provide a user-friendly interface for users to select and apply the desired compression method(s) to their key event logs.


Team 4: Documentation and Tutorials
  Objectives:
    Create comprehensive documentation on the usage of the library and its functions.
    Develop tutorials and guides for users to integrate the library into their QMK keyboards.

  Tasks:
    Document the usage of the library and its functions, including examples and best practices.
    Create tutorials and guides for users who want to integrate the library into their QMK keyboards.
    Continuously update documentation and tutorials as needed based on user feedback and improvements in the library.
    As CTO, you'll need to coordinate the work of these four teams, ensure smooth communication, and manage the project timeline. Each team will have its own backlog of tasks, which should be regularly updated and prioritized based on the project's progress and any new information or challenges that arise.
